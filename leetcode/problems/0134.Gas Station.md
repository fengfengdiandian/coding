---

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

Note:

If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
Example 1:

Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
Example 2:

Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

这里有一个 O(n) 时间复杂度的解法。

常规的思路是选定一个点，然后从这个点出发，查看能否走完一圈。但是最差的情况下需要 选 n 次起点。

观察发现，当选定某个起点时，就算不能走完一圈，走过的这一段的消耗和补给都是固定的，所以可以利用好这一个结果：
1. 当剩余 gas 能走完接下来的这一站，就往右走
2. 当剩余 gas 不能走完接下来的这一站，说明当前的起点有问题，所以起点可以往左移一个，然后把新起点的消耗和补给都算上
3. 一种重复前两步，直到起点和终点重合。
4. 这里有一个坑，输入的数组可能只有一个值

```
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        final int NUM = gas.length;
        // 选第1个站为起始站
        int start = 0;
        int end = (NUM == 1 ? 0 : 1);
        // rest 表示走到 end 站时剩余的 gas
        int rest = gas[0] - cost[0];
        do {
            if (rest >= 0) {
                rest += gas[end] - cost[end];
                end = (end + 1) % NUM;
            } else {
                start = (start + NUM - 1) % NUM;
                rest += gas[start] - cost[start];
            }
        } while (start != end);
        return rest >= 0 ? start : -1;
    }
}
```
